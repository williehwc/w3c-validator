This is a modification of srackham's w3c-validator for grading students' HTML/CSS frontends.
Students can also use this script to make sure that their files are W3C-compliant.
It recursively checks every HTML and CSS file in the current directory.
Note that only errors (not warnings) are printed.

== Usage
Go to the directory that you are grading, then enter

HTML:

  python w3c-validator.py
  
CSS:
  
  python w3c-validator.py --css
  
Verbose HTML (for troubleshooting):

  python w3c-validator.py --verbose

- http://validator.w3.org/docs/users.html[User's guide for the W3C
  Markup Validator].
- http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/manual.html[CSS Validator User's
  Manual].


== Prerequisites
- Python.
- Curl (the `curl(1)` command must be in the shell 'PATH').
- An Internet connection.

Written and tested on Xubuntu 10.04 with Python 2.6.5, should work on other Python platforms.
Also works on macOS.
